Literally just a basic encoder.
Input text you wish to encode into message.txt. This will output to encodedmessage.txt, and anything encoded with the encoder can be decoded by putting it (or leaving it) in encoded message.txt. This will output into decodedmessage.txt.
In order to encode or decode you must input an ID. 
Eventually I am planning on adding more but for now the only ID is "Sorry" (Note it is case sensitive)
